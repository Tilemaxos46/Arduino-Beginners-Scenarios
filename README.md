# Arduino-Beginners-Scenarios
 This Repository is a package of Arduino scripts that we developed with Prof. Angelos Michalas for learning Arduino programming for beginners. These scenarios have been well received by both students and the Tinkercad community with hundreds of Remixes over the past 3 years. The aim of these courses is initially for the learners to get to know Arduino and the basic principles of designing circuits with Arduino Uno and Breadboard through the Tinkercad platform and then to program Modules such as: Leds, Photoresistor, LM35 Sensor, Buttons and Buzzers.
