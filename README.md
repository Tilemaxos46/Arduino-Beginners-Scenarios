# Arduino Scenarios for Beginners

## General info
This Repository is a package of Arduino scenarios, which were developed in collaboration with Professor Angelos Michalas. The goal of these scenarios is to teach Arduino programming for beginners. The scenarios have been well accepted by students and the Tinkercad community alike, with hundreds of remixes over the past 3 years.
These courses are initially aimed at introducing learners to Arduino. Then, they get to know the fundamentals of circuit design with an Arduino Uno and Breadboard using the Tinkercad platform. Finally, they are asked to program Modules such as: Leds, Photoresistor, LM35 Sensor, Buttons and Buzzers.

## Technologies
Scenarios were designed with:
* Tinkercad
* Arduino Uno
* Breadboard
* LM35
* Led and RGB Led
* Photoresistor
* Button
* Buzzer
